                <p>Traning 365 wanted us to make a site and app for their members so that are easier for them to book group training. The site will also give inspirational and motivational articles for the members to workout more.</p>

                <p> We made apps both for android and iOS. The website is also responsive which means that the members doesnâ€™t need to download the app to surf the site.</p>
